## Hi there 👋


**MalKhar/MalKhar** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a dashboard in Next.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning node.js and Next.js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that gives me a challenge
- 💬 Ask me about chess
- 📫 How to reach me: @brunocbranco_
- 😄 Pronouns: He / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Mittens, which is the name of a chess bot who has a cat as it's avatar.
